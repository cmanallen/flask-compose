### Sample Implementation

To demonstrate the powerful, labor-saving efficiencies of the "Decorator Design Pattern" and the "flask-router" library a simple Flask application has been created.

##### Installation

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Run Server

```bash
$ python examples/app/__init__.py
```

##### Code Review

Those aspects of this application unrelated to "flask-router" were put together with little care. A selection of files which should be considered when introducing yourself to the library have been listed below:

1. components.py
2. controllers.py
3. routes.py

The remaining files can be studied to understand the context in which the above files operate. But ultimately, those files are outside the scope of this application and were paid little mind.
